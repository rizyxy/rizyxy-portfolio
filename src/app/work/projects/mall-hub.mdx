With MallHub, visitors can quickly browse through categories, discover stores, and find exactly what they need—whether it’s fashion, electronics, or dining —all in one easy-to-use platform.

For stores, MallHub provides a simple way to promote products, announce real-time sales, and attract more visitors without the hassle of traditional marketing. This creates a powerful win–win ecosystem: shoppers save time and find deals, while businesses gain visibility and drive traffic.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The MallHub Mobile App is developed using Flutter, leveraging its capability for efficient, cross-platform deployment to both iOS and Android. Architecture follows the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern to ensure superior separation of concerns, long-term maintainability, and high code quality across the codebase.

- **Laravel**: The backend is built with Laravel (PHP Framework), selected for its mature ecosystem, robust security features, and development velocity. A powerful administrative interface was rapidly constructed using Filament. This server layer is responsible for managing core business logic and provides all necessary data endpoints to the mobile app via a structured REST API.

- **FastAPI**: The dedicated Recommender System is a content-based engine built atop FastAPI (Python framework). This choice was critical for achieving high-performance request handling and enabling native, streamlined integration with industry-standard machine learning and data processing libraries required for generating accurate user recommendations.

- **NLP**: NLP is used to build the Recommender System model. The pipeline consists of NLTK for text preprocessing, TF-IDF for the feature extraction, and Cosine Similarity to calculate the relatedness between products, ensuring accurate and relevant recommendations.

- **PostgreSQL**: All persistent data for the MallHub platform is managed by PostgreSQL. This relational database was selected for its advanced features, transactional integrity, and extensibility, ensuring reliable and scalable data handling across the entire ecosystem.
