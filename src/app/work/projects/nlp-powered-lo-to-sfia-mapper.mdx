## Overview

This project addresses the challenge of manually mapping unstructured learning outcomes to structured skill frameworks like the Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA). The goal was to design and evaluate an automated, NLP-driven approach to map computing study programs in Indonesia to SFIA skills, significantly reducing a previously time-intensive process.

## Methods

My methodology involved a comparative analysis of various NLP techniques:

Skill Extraction: I utilized SkillNER and a custom Hybrid SkillNER Query Expansion to identify key skills from the learning outcome data.

Feature Extraction: I experimented with traditional TF-IDF and advanced BERT models (including DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and all-miniLM-L6-v2) to represent the data.

Skill Matching: The similarity between learning outcomes and SFIA skills was calculated using cosine similarity.

The project successfully demonstrated that a combination of these methods can effectively automate the mapping process. The most effective approach, which combined SkillNER for skill extraction and TF-IDF for feature extraction, achieved a balanced F1-score of 56%, with 47% precision and 70% recall.

This project showcases my expertise in natural language processing, data analysis, and the development of efficient, data-driven solutions.
