## Overview

SchoolHub is a Learning Management System (LMS) designed to empower educators and engage students. We bridge the gap between content creation and personalized study with a centralized, teacher-driven question bank and an automated quiz generator.

**For Teachers**: Effortlessly create and categorize educational content into a centralized Question Bank. Control the depth and scope of your material, ensuring your questions align perfectly with your curriculum goals. Say goodbye to repetitive test creationâ€”your content is ready to be deployed instantly.

**For Students**: Take charge of your study time. Students can select any topic from the question bank and instantly generate a randomized, unique quiz. This adaptive quizzing feature ensures effective practice, mastery of core concepts, and preparation for high-stakes assessments, turning review time into a focused, low-stress learning experience.

**Key Features:**

- **Centralized Question Bank**: Secure, real-time storage for unlimited questions, categorized by topic.

- **Randomized Quiz Generation**: Instantly create unique quizzes based on selected topics.

- **Real-Time Scoring**: Immediate feedback and performance tracking.

## Technologies Used

SchoolHub is built on a modern, scalable, and cross-platform architecture designed for high availability and long-term maintenance.

- **Flutter (Cross-Platform Mobile Client)**: Selected for its ability to build beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile devices from a single codebase. We implemented the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern to ensure clear separation of concerns, robust state management, high readability, and long-term scalability.

- **Laravel (Backend API & Server)**: Serving as the robust and secure backbone of the application, Laravel provides a powerful PHP framework for handling API endpoints, authentication, and business logic. The Filament package was utilized to rapidly develop a rich, intuitive, and efficient Admin Panel for teacher/administrator management of users and content.

- **PostgreSQL (Relational Database)**: Chosen as the primary data store for its advanced features, transactional integrity, and stability. PostgreSQL ensures reliable, structured storage for the Question Bank, user data, and quiz performance metrics.
