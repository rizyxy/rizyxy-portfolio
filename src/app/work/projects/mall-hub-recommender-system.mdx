## Overview

The MallHub Similar Products Engine is a specialized component of the recommender system focused on intelligently mapping product relationships across the entire mall catalogue. Its core function is to immediately surface high-relevance alternatives, complementary items, and upgrades to the visitor based on the item they are currently viewing.

## value

- **Similarity Mapping**
  The engine analyzes rich product dataâ€”including item descriptions to understand which items are true substitutes or logical pairings.

- **Conversion Optimization**:
  By providing a curated list of relevant alternatives directly on the product detail page, the system reduces the risk of a shopper abandoning the search, increasing the likelihood of a successful conversion within the MallHub ecosystem.

## Technologies Used

MallHub Recommender System is built on top of FastAPI.
